# Paroi007-IoT-based-Attendance-System-using-RFID-Tag
Deployed the RfID system, the admin can successfully maintain and track arrival and departure times of individudal students. Also record every student's daily, monthly attendance data.
#Software Required:
    1. Arduino IDE
    2. LAMP Server for Linux or WAMP Server for Windows
#Hardware Used:
    1. Node MCU V3(ESP8266) 
    2. RFID(RC522) Reader with Tag
    3. Jumper Wires
#Implementation Details:
Firstly connected Node MCU ESP8266 and RFID- RC522 with MYSQL Database. So for that first we should connect our Node MCU ESP8266 Board with RFID Module. By using the RFID Module we are going to scan our RFID card and tag which are allow or not. And by using our ESP8266 we are going to send that data to our MYSQL  Database which is connect through a php page.
